Aneris is a multi-client data coupling agent written in Python.

    "In Discordian mythology, Aneris is described as the sister of Eris aka
    Discordia. Whereas Eris/Discordia is the Goddess of Disorder and Being,
    Aneris/Harmonia is the Goddess of Order and Non-Being."

    -- Wikipedia

It was designed to handle the data communication needs for the European 
Commission FP7 Energy project “Optimal Design Tools for Ocean Arrays”
(DTOcean).
